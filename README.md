# covid_spread
Mathematical model to help answer the questions "how long will we need to stay home?" and "how bad will COVID-19 get?"

Please excuse the very rough form of this code.  It was done in haste.  We deeply welcome improvements to the model, and experiments to simulate different input assumptions.
